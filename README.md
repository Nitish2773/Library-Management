**Library management**

The Library Management System is a web application designed to help users manage their book collections efficiently. Users can add new books, view a list of books, edit book details, 
and delete books from the library. The application features a user-friendly interface and is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and data handling.
